### HTLM CSS Code Refactoring

Horiseon is the an example of a working site that has been refactored to follow accessibility 
standards, so that the source code has a polished look and approprate use of semantics.

The HTML and CSS elements have been optimized to reflect proper semantics, and a great 
user experience with functioning features. This includes updating the elements
for proper sectioning of the content of the site. The CSS Stylesheet elements have been 
cosolidated to cut down on the amount of code required to get the same look and
have a more efficient code layout.
